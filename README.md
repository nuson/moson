`moson` (micro-organism sonification) is a collection of auditory display tools for the 
sonification and audification of atomic force microscope data recordings of
the micro organism *Dunaliella salina* by Richard Thompson at the University of Durham's Department of Chemistry. The auditory display aspects are part of Louise 
Mackenzie's larger [Microbial Sensing](http://www.viralexperiments.co/#!viral-experiment-2/cle2)
research project. The auditory displays in `moson` were featured in Mackenzie's 
[Stars Beneath our Feet](http://www.lumiere-festival.com/programme/durham/the-stars-beneath-our-feet/) 
installation as part of [Lumiere Durham 2015](http://www.lumiere-festival.com/durham-2015/), a four day international light festival produced by Artichoke..

The sonification tool `BacteriaActivity` is a patch for Max/MSP. The audification tool
`Audify` is a Python executable.
