.txt files are tab separated floating point values of atomic force microscope (AFM) data. Column 1 
is the time stamp and column 2 is the AFM sensor value.

The file name indicates the length of the file in seconds, so the sampling rate can be 
calculated by dividing this by the number of rows - 1 (the first row is a header).

.jpg files are plots of the data.
